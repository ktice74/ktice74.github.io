          <div class="about-text">
            <div class="intro">
              <p class="pre-animation">I'm Kindy Tice, a product of the Midwest although I most recently scratched my California itch for three and a half years. In the Bay Area, I gained valuable work experience in <b>web design</b> and <b>programming</b>, successfully completing a number of courses in both disciplines, most recently <b>Dev Bootcamp</b>> DBC is an immersive four month coding bootcamp. As a techno optimist, I can't think of anything more exciting after waking up than being at the intersection of people and technology. As technology continues to advance exponentially, I will eagerly be at this intersection with a passion to learn the technologies of today and tomorrow.</p>
              <h2 class="pre-animation">What Drives Me</h2>
              <p class="pre-animation">I'm an <b>intrinsically motivated</b> individual who feels most comfortable being <b>part of a team</b>. I naturally form <b>meaningful relationships</b> with coworkers and clients alike because I have no problem rolling up my sleeves and getting the job done. When I've been in positions of leadership, I lead by example from the front lines. I've been fortunate enough to be a part of a number of successful teams and I know that a big part of team success is realizing that the whole is greater than the sum total of its parts.</p>
              <h2 class="pre-animation">Why Programming</h2>
              <p class="pre-animation">Coming out of college, it was my natural inclination to <b>help others</b> and be a "<b>man for others</b>." Customer service was a natural fit and my first stop was <b>iStream Financial Services</b>, an electronic payment processing company in the Milwaukee area. At iStream I was exposed to our team of <b>developers</b>, whom I admired personally and professionally. Specifically, their quiet confidence and the trust the rest of the company had in their team made me want to garner the same professional respect. Working closely alongside the team on a daily basis inspired me to express my creativity and logic reasoning through the medium of development. This ultimately led me to move to San Francisco to learn the craft of web development.<br><br>
              Upon landing in the Bay Area, I enrolled in a number of classes in <b>Ruby, HTML5, JavaScript</b> and <b>web design</b>, just to name a few. I brought my knowledge to the table professionally and did web design work while at <b>Betabrand</b> and <b>Newton Software</b>.After successfully completing <b>Dev Bootcamp</b>, I have successfully transitioned my career from a reactive problem-solving support technician into a proactive problem solver as a developer.</p>

              <h2>Improving Efficiencies</h2>
                <p>One of the most underrated qualities and one that I try to embody the most is efficiency. Both in a personal sense but also in a business sense. With over four years in a technical, customer-facing role, I am familiar with common customer struggles and how to mitigate these common software issues at the pre-production level which saves headaches on both sides.</p>

              <h2>Full Stack Development</h2>
                <p>Recent successful completion of DBC has supplemented my prior knowledge in web design. I have tools and skills to build a web or mobile app from the ground up. This means user stories, UI/UX, robust backends utilizing MVC framework and RESTful Routes, all the way to a stylized front end and successful deployment.</p>

                <p>I completed my undergrad degree in Communication Studies at Marquette University and I believe that there is a growing need to bridge technology to the non-sophisticated user. </p>
                <p>Working with a team of developers is about more than just the code. It's about working together, attaching meaning and purpose to your code and keeping a level head against tight deadlines.</p>

                      <p><b>(2001-2004)</b><br>The local little league had an inefficient, parent/volunteer run concessions stand. My best friend and I proposed and secured a loan for the League's board to run it on our own. Over four years, we generated over $16,000 for the league. I maintained inventory through a Sam's Club membership and balanced the books.</p>

                      <p><b>2006</b><br/>Not as glamorous as running a concessions stand, the summer before college I worked the 6am shift at the meat package factory while running 60 miles/week in preperation for collegiate cross country. The hard work sure made me appreciate my life path that led me to college.</p>
