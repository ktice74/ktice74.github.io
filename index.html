            <div class="intro">
              <p>I'm Kindy Tice, a product of the Midwest although I most recently scratched my California itch for three and a half years. In the Bay Area, I gained valuable work experience in <b>web design</b> and <b>programming</b> and successfully completed a number of courses in both disciplines, most recently <b>Dev Bootcamp</b>, an immersive four month coding bootcamp. As a techno optimist, I can't think of doing anything more exciting with my life. As technology continues to advance exponentially, I will eagerly at the intersection of people and technology with a passion to learn the technologies of today and tomorrow.</p>
              <h2>What Drives Me</h2>
              <p>I'm an <b>intrinsically motivated</b> individual who feels most comfortable being <b>part of a team</b>. I naturally form <b>meaningful relationships</b> with coworkers and clients alike because I have no problem rolling up my sleeves and getting the job done. When I've been in positions of leadership, I lead by example from the front lines. I've been fortunate enough to be a part of a number of successful teams and I know that a big part of team success is realizing that the whole is greater than the sum total of its parts.</p>
              <h2>Why Programming</h2>
              <p>Coming out of college, it was my natural inclination to <b>help others</b> and be a "<b>man for others</b>." Customer service was a natural fit and my first stop was <b>iStream Financial Services</b>, an electronic payment processing company in the Milwaukee area. At iStream I was exposed to our team of <b>developers</b>, whom I admired personally and professionally. I admired their quiet confidence and the trust the rest of the company had in their team. Working closely with them inspired me to express my creativity and logic reasoning through the medium of development, which ultimately led me to move to San Francisco to learn the craft.</p>
              <p>Upon landing in the Bay Area, I enrolled in a number of classes in <b>Ruby, HTML5, JavaScript</b> and <b>web design</b>, just to name a few. I brought my knowledge to the table professionally and did web design work while at <b>Betabrand</b> and <b>Newton Software</b>.After successfully completing <b>Dev Bootcamp</b>, I am eager to transition my career from a reactive problem-solving support technician into a proactive problem solver as a developer.</p>

              <h2>Improving Efficiencies</h2>
                <p>One of the most underrated qualities and one that I try to embody the most is efficiency. Both in a personal sense but also in a business sense. With over four years in a technical, customer-facing role, I am familiar with common customer struggles and how to mitigate these common software issues at the pre-production level which saves headaches on both sides.</p>

              <h2>Full Stack Development</h2>
                <p>Recent successful completion of DBC has supplemented my prior knowledge in web design. I have tools and skills to build a web or mobile app from the ground up. This means user stories, UI/UX, robust backends utilizing MVC framework and RESTful Routes, all the way to a stylized front end and successful deployment.</p>

                <p>I completed my undergrad degree in Communication Studies at Marquette University and I believe that there is a growing need to bridge technology to the non-sophisticated user. </p>
                <p>Working with a team of developers is about more than just the code. It's about working together, attaching meaning and purpose to your code and keeping a level head against tight deadlines.</p>
