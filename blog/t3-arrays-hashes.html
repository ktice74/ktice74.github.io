      <p>Arrays of Insight: Hashing out Arrays and Hashes in Ruby</p>


 <p></p>Arrays and hashes are just a list on your computer, or more specifically, they are indexed collections. Both store collections of objects and are accessible using a key. The reason that you would want to use an array or hash is because variables can only hold one item at a time. Arrays and hashes can hold multiple items and the list can grow over time.</p>

<p>For arrays, the keys are integers, as each object in the list is automatically assigned a place holder value (or in Ruby speak, an index) which starts at zero.</p>

<p>Let’s go ahead and create a list.
>> data = [“mishu”, 3, 0.745, true, (0, 3)]
Arrays can be heterogenous, meaning that all of the values do not have to be the same data types. The above is a valid array, and you will not receive an error even though the values are respectively, a string, integer, float, boolean value and then another array.</p>

<h1>Arrays</h1>

<p>Each value within the array has a placeholder (or in Ruby-speak, indexes), which start with 0. So if we were to ask ruby:
data[0] it would return “mishu” because the string “mishu” is in the first placeholder.
We can also see how many total values are contained in the array by asking >> data.size which returns => 5.</p>

<p>While the values in an array have the keys of automatically assigned indexes, hashes on the other hand allow you to assign each value with their own unique key.</p>

<p>As you can imagine, arrays are easier to build and keep track of, while hashes allow for more flexibility.</p>

<h1>Hashes</h1>

<p>Take a look at this hash (and notice that we’re using a squiggly bracket instead of a square bracket that are assigned to arrays.

<span style="margin-left: 20px;">>> home_teams = {
 ‘Brewers’ => ‘baseball’,
 ‘Packers’ => ‘football’,
 ‘Bucks’ => ‘basketball’,
 ‘Admirals’ => ‘hockey’,
 ‘Wave’ => ‘soccer'
}</span>
</p>

<p>In this hash, I’ve assigned the values of each (Milwaukee area) home sports team and assigned their keys to be the sports that they represent.
</p>
<p>So if I wanted to know the home_team [‘football’], Ruby would tell me that the value would be ‘Packers’.</p>

<p>I could then create a separate hash for adopted_hometeams and list all of the Bay Area sports teams:


<span style="margin-left: 20px;">>> adopted_hometeams = {
 ‘Giants’ => ‘baseball’,
 ‘49ers’ => ‘football’,
 ‘Warriors’ => ‘basketball’,
 ’Sharks’ => ‘hockey’,
 ‘Earthquakes’ => ‘soccer’,
}</span></p>

<p>If I were to ask for adopted_hometeams [‘football’], ruby would return ‘49ers’. Since there are individualized local variables for each array, we don’t have to worry about having the same key names within each hash.</p>
