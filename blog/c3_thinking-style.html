      <p>Checking in on an Abstract Learner after Phase 0</p>


 <p>In figuring out my <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">Gregorc thinking style</a>, I am equal parts Abstract Sequential and Abstract Random learning styles. My scores for the Abstract outweighed the values for Concrete by almost triple.
</p>

<p>Since my different learning styles are so heavily weighted towards the Abstract, I will focus on the differences between Abstract and Concrete learning styles. Abstract learners rely on their intuition and imagination. I feel like this way of thinking has helped me thus far in my phase-0 preperation as I have been able to learn new concepts on the fly and embrace the challenge of being in uncharted waters.
</p>
<p>While this abstract way of thinking has helped me adapt on the fly, at certain times I may not be spending enough time grasping the concepts and spending too much time trying to solve the equation on my own.</p>

<p>While attempting to solve the equation on my own allows me to eventually learn the concepts through trial and error, it is often times most efficient and reliable in the long run to focus on grasping the concepts rather than focusing on the equation.</p>

<p>I think that this relates to fixed vs. growth mindset because grasping the concepts allows for longterm growth while simply doing an equation in front of you is a short term gain. I need to find the balance between getting a firm grasp of the concepts before jumping into the equations and making sure that I'm not solving the concepts out of sheer luck and actually having an intellectual approach to solving the problems.</p>
