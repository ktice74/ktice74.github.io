I came across this quiz, which asks <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/quiz-know-internet-works/">Do you know how the internet works?</a>. Somewhat embarassingly, I only answered 9 out of 12 questions correctly (I even read most of Lean In, but didn't recognize Sheryl Sandberg's name... grr...). While this result disappointed me, it still placed me in the 10th percentile of all people who have taken this online survey.

This got me thinking. Nearly all of us use the Internet everyday and have a dependency on it to get through our day to day lives. However, how many of us actually understand how it works? Probably a very small amount. With this being said, allow me to provide a brief overview of what is occuring when we access various webpages.

The first question on the quiz, and the first question I answered incorrectly was asking if the Internet and the world wide web are the same thing. They are not! Let's get a better understand the word "Internet." If you connect two or more computers together, you have what is called a network. Let's say your friend also has a computer that is connected to one or more other computers, that is also a network. Now if you connect those two networks and all agree to play by the same rules, you have what is called an inter-network, hence Internet!

What are the rules that we all agree to play by? Why, the internet protocol (or IP). When you see that word, you probably think of an IP address. Indeed, each computer has unique address. IP addresses are in the nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn format, where nnn must be a number from 0-255. Any information sent over the Internet is really just a message sent from one address to another.
