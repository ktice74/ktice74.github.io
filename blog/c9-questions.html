Bueller?... Bueller?... Bueller?

We all know the feeling of asking a question and not having it answered. The feeling is a mix of regret (why did I ask this question in the first place?), helplessness (now I'll never get it answered) and finally the frontiersman/woman attitude of blazing the trail and answering the question on your own.

When I think of questions being unanswered during my prep time at DBC, the issues were almost always on my end. In the Google Hangout group, I think I had two unanswered pairing invitation requests. In thinking back on my requests, I did not follow the Golden Rule and think of putting myself in the person answering the questions shoes. My requests were usually last minute ("Are you available to pair right now?") and offered no alternatives (I am working on JavaScript problems).

What I learned from not getting responses with my questions is that I need to open up my questions to invlove other perspectives. Whether it's asking a question on Stack Overflow or asking for a pairing invitation, instead of submitting my code and telling them what direction I am going, I should also make the question open ended so that people answering are able to add their input/opinion to the problem, rather than feeling like they have to use the methodology that I used.
